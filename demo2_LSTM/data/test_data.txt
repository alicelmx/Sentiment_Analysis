My choice, however, is a surprising one for me, given how happy I was at the indie revolution: I really wanted Tom Cruise to win for Jerry Maguire.
UCLA is beautiful.
Harvard's was especially unfortunate as it took out Katie Johnston, who had a goal and an assist on Harvard's only two goals at that point.
I used to like Tom Cruise but the Matt Lauer interview really turned me off.
But I still like the most your shots with the Volkswagen.

I hate the damn Seattle Seahawks.

I'm not crazy about HK either, but Shanghai is sounding awesome.
I like honda civics!!!!!!.
I hate London!!!!!!!
I hope you know that the Purdue History program generally sucks ass...
the 911 was introduced in 1966, Mercedes was selling the fantastic Pagoda W113 roadster, and Volkswagen was busy taking over the world with the brilliant Beetle.
Though I want a Vios / Honda Jazz badly, I think I'll be fine in a 2nd hand Myvi or Waja or Gen 2 or anything decent.
As i stepped out of my beautiful Toyota, i heard a scream as a gust of wind had just passed.
After that, we started watching Interview with a Vampire, but Ed wouldn ’ t watch any further than a few minutes in because Tom Cruise sucked.

Stupid UCLA, deserves a good poking..

Well, first thing to do before blogging about my trip to Shanghai is this dumb little meme:..
The history here goes back to the summer of 1992, when the San Francisco Giants were terrible.
Since then, 25 automakers including Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. have recalled about 370,000 defective vehicles, according to the agency.
I both love and hate coming to these Harvard board meetings.
stupid lakers.....
Shanghai is beautiful ~..
harvard is dumb, i mean they really have to be stupid to have not wanted her to be at their school.
I LOVE San Francisco, it is one of my favorite cities.
Today, when Monkee was backing out of the Milpitas Library's parking lot, some old asian man driving a Toyota was driving the wrong way.

i hate lakers..
Harvard Square is a beautiful sight when the women start putting on their warm-weather clothes..

i'm sick of the summit egos and the mit incompetence.
I'm beginning to really distrust Toyota dealerships.
Well apparently all people driving toyota 4runners are appalingly ugly, or so one would think based on him not even glancing in my direction!
I loved the Lakers episode where he told that little blonde he wants to see a woman rule the world in his lifetime because women know how to look after the pack.
Finally, no post about the UCLA-Oregon game would be complete without a complaint about the shitty, shitty, Pac-10 officiating that went down today.
lost a friend recently, Chris Handy, it isnt going to be the same without seeing him tooling around clinton in crappy Honda, with a header..(

Seattle sucks!!
UCLA is a good school for many reasons, but school pride is so insane here.
UCLA is stupid, I realized.
Along the sides of exit fly-over there were parallel parking spots for " attractive cars only " — the sign listed several criteria of which my crappy Honda qualified for none.
stupid, stupid UCLA..
I need to pay Geico and a host of other bills but that is neither here nor there.
I also like Boston.
One thing is for sure: San Francisco itself is amazing and didn't disappoint in the slightest.
Apparently, MIT and Olin are awesome.
I hated Boston.
Whether we liked Hillary Clinton, or not, many of us are getting understanding about the need for health care reform.
San Francisco's Disastrous Policy Exposed!..
harvard is for dumb people.
Today, I remembered how particularly sad it is that the details of Angelina Jolie's pregnancy, or Jennifer Aniston's latest living arrangement must be screamed out at hapless grocery shoppers the world over.

Going out in Seattle people are just friendlier and more open minded ( and open legged...; ) ).
But I think the American Express ad would be pretty funny...

Today, when Monkee was backing out of the Milpitas Library's parking lot, some old asian man driving a Toyota was driving the wrong way.
Tom Cruise and the rest of the morons propogating scientology with their utter lack of talent for anything other than sounding dumb are second only to the idiots on ET on my killing spree.
aaa u so evil..
i hate the lakers..
Personally, I blame Angelina Jolie, a psychologically-damaged attention-seeker who seems to have somehow convinced almost every woman on LJ that having an icon with her face on it makes you a sexually-interesting noncomformist wildchild.
The seattle scene is pretty amazing too....
he loves NYC too much in my opinion ( because i'll always love my seattle too much )...
Since then, 25 automakers including Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. have recalled about 370,000 defective vehicles, according to the agency.

Once there was a rather trumped up play in London that was absolutely terrible to watch.
I hate my toyota 86 corolla.

The Harvard-Yale study was depressing, she says, " but my thought was,'I'm not a statistic.
He was saying the usual " kobe and lakers suck " stuff and I was saying how Jazz didn't even make playoffs and at least Lakers made it.
Along the sides of exit fly-over there were parallel parking spots for " attractive cars only " — the sign listed several criteria of which my crappy Honda qualified for none.

This means we beat out schools like MIT, which is amazing for a relatively small, unassuming lil'IS department.
I blame capital one.
Personally, I blame Angelina Jolie, a psychologically-damaged attention-seeker who seems to have somehow convinced almost every woman on LJ that having an icon with her face on it makes you a sexually-interesting noncomformist wildchild.
        Purdue sucks because 99 % of things are more expensive than chicago while the living cost is evaluated to be less than Chicago which results in the lower payment in income..

Seattle sucks in bumper to bumper if you're on a hill with a stick shift.
Along the sides of exit fly-over there were parallel parking spots for " attractive cars only " — the sign listed several criteria of which my crappy Honda qualified for none.

The many prejudices that I will face being in the San Francisco Region are going to be difficult.

Boston Gal arrived last night and it was great to stay up and catch up with her, but the Hub and I are definitely feeling the effects today...
I do know that as much as I loved San Francisco ( I did, I truly did ) I sometimes felt struck, wounded even, by the impersonality that peoples its streets...
I think Angelina Jolie is so much more beautiful than Jennifer Anniston, who, by the way, is majorly OVERRATED.
As much as I said I hate UCLA, I think I'm finally finally learning to love it.
Stupid UCLA.
I love toyota I think I am going to get the truck just not 100 % sure yet.

Cs: I've heard San Francisco is beautiful..

Angelina Jolie says that being self-destructive is selfish and you ought to think of the poor, starving, mutilated people all around the world.
When Emmy was in town, I told her ( in a moment of pure physical pain as we hiked up to the Lombard / Leavenworth intersection ) that San Francisco is always halfway between fantastic and miserable.
I hate Tom Cruise, but I liked the idea I was passing by somebody famous...
Well apparently all people driving toyota 4runners are appalingly ugly, or so one would think based on him not even glancing in my direction!
I like Purdue University's computer lab!..
tom cruise sucks.
Though I want a Vios / Honda Jazz badly, I think I'll be fine in a 2nd hand Myvi or Waja or Gen 2 or anything decent.

Angelina Jolie says that being self-destructive is selfish and you ought to think of the poor, starving, mutilated people all around the world.
For those who say he doesn't deserve it cuz the Lakers stink and are barely over.
either or, not too big though, I think Angelina Jolie's are unattractive.

Seattle sucks!!
I like honda civics!!!!!!.
I detest the homeless population of San Francisco.
That's why I most love the Harvard story:
lost a friend recently, Chris Handy, it isnt going to be the same without seeing him tooling around clinton in crappy Honda, with a header..(
Powered by a Toyota-tuned version of Holden's abysmal Starfire four, the XT130 Corona was a cynical, superficial, poorly conceived mess.
This one is pretending to be a reaction to Kelo v. New London, which was admittedly a stupid ruling.
Wow, having XP on my MacBook would be awesome...
Have I told you I hate Tom Cruise?..
I need some of that geico balboa stuff..
I love Boston too!
Wow, having XP on my MacBook would be awesome...
Personally, I blame Angelina Jolie, a psychologically-damaged attention-seeker who seems to have somehow convinced almost every woman on LJ that having an icon with her face on it makes you a sexually-interesting noncomformist wildchild.
BOSTON IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING..
angelina jolie is so beautiful that i don't even have the desire to attain such exquisite beauty..

Because nothing says “ I really, really love Angelina Jolie ” like making it publicly clear that your marriage to her hinges on whether or not the close-minded among us suddenly open their minds.
I think Angelina Jolie is so much more beautiful than Jennifer Anniston, who, by the way, is majorly OVERRATED.
GEICO is a GREAT ride.
I WANT MY MACBOOK BLACK.........
And I just really, really dislike Angelina Jolie, completely irrationally.
Anyway, some crappy Honda, but, as is young peoples'customs, it has a good $ 2 million worth of sound equipment inside.
I loved the Lakers episode where he told that little blonde he wants to see a woman rule the world in his lifetime because women know how to look after the pack.

As i stepped out of my beautiful Toyota, i heard a scream as a gust of wind had just passed.
When I saw the letter that said 19,000 people applied, I no longer feel so crappy about the Harvard thing.
When Emmy was in town, I told her ( in a moment of pure physical pain as we hiked up to the Lombard / Leavenworth intersection ) that San Francisco is always halfway between fantastic and miserable.
Personally, I blame Angelina Jolie, a psychologically-damaged attention-seeker who seems to have somehow convinced almost every woman on LJ that having an icon with her face on it makes you a sexually-interesting noncomformist wildchild.
Uh,. I-I-I hear the Paris Hilton is very beautiful...
By the time I left the Hospital, I had no time to drive to Boston-which sucked because 1)
either or, not too big though, I think Angelina Jolie's are unattractive.
" The guy with the " Y " on his shirt says, " Oh yeah, well Harvard really sucks!

Traffic in Seattle does stink, but it's a beautiful city to be stuck in.
Personally, I blame Angelina Jolie, a psychologically-damaged attention-seeker who seems to have somehow convinced almost every woman on LJ that having an icon with her face on it makes you a sexually-interesting noncomformist wildchild.
I love Shanghai, it's such a great city, and Hongzhou is only a two hour train ride away from it.

Lora is on her Acer and me on my MacBook Pro ( which is awesome. ) Thank you Atlanta Bread Company for being close and having WiFi.
Oh man, last night's Lakers playoff game was awesome.

When Emmy was in town, I told her ( in a moment of pure physical pain as we hiked up to the Lombard / Leavenworth intersection ) that San Francisco is always halfway between fantastic and miserable.
lumabas ata ako ts nagbike ng onting-onti ts nakita ko si basile nags-soccer.
